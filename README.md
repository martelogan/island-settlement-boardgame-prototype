# island-settlement-boardgame-prototype
This project implements a complete prototype of an android board game based on "[island settlers](https://www.xda-developers.com/island-settlers-board-game-for-android/)" rules
in addition to several large-scale expansions (incl. ships, knights, barbarians, and fishing). 

The project was redesigned from scratch but inherits skeleton logic & algorithms from our earlier work on <br>
[hexagonal-experiments-in-android](https://github.com/martelogan/hexagonal-experiments-in-android/)

In turn, that project leveraged boilerplate courtesy of Neil Isaac and Adam Garland's [AndroidSettlers](https://github.com/neilisaac/AndroidSettlers) project.
So, we preserve their original license file and link to their README found [here](https://github.com/neilisaac/AndroidSettlers).

For code further extending our development work here, please credit:

* main application development: **Logan Martel** and **Frederick Parsons**
* main graphical resources: **Jessica Dorval**, and **Jenna Mar** 
* boilerplate: derived from [hexagonal-experiments-in-android](https://github.com/martelogan/hexagonal-experiments-in-android/) - which in turn credits **Neil Isaac** & **Adam Garland**
* some progress cards & miscellaneous graphics: **Abhinav Bhandari**, **Laily Popal** and **Philip Modupe**
